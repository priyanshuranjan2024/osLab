2.pass two intergers and thread has to make a summation.
3.create 2 threads display 1 to 1000 by each thread and also parent.
4.take a global variable a=0.create 2 threads and each of them will increment a 100000 time and display the last result by parent.
5.pass on carry's 1st half to t1 -> summation
2nd half to t2 -> summation 
parent has to add  g[0]+g[1]
6.apply merge sort using threads
7.matrix mulitiplication of two matrixes and parent has to show the result using threads
8.p1 (16)-> t1(16) -> t2(8) -> t3(4) -> t4(2) -> t5(1) cascading display in reverse  order .
